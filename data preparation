Data Preparation and Basic Visualizations

Data Cleaning with Power Query

Open Power Query Editor (Home > Transform Data).
Steps: Remove duplicates, filter rows (e.g., exclude null values), split columns, merge tables.
Example: Clean a dataset by removing rows where Sales Amount < 0.
Apply changes and load back to Power BI.
Building Your First Report

Switch to Report view.

Create visuals: Drag fields from Fields pane to canvas.
Table: Display raw data.
Bar Chart: X-axis = Product, Y-axis = Sum of Sales Amount.
Pie Chart: For regional breakdowns.
Customize: Change colors, add titles, enable tooltips (hover for details).

Interactivity and Filters

Add slicers: Insert > Slicer > Drag Region field – filters all visuals on the page.
Drill-down: Right-click a bar in a chart to explore sub-levels (e.g., from category to subcategory).
Cross-filtering: Click a visual element to filter others.

Hands-On Exercise

Build a simple dashboard: Import sample data, create 3 visuals (chart, table, map), add a slicer.
Publish to Power BI Service (File > Publish) for sharing.

Key Takeaways

Power BI emphasizes data preparation before visualization.
Start simple: Focus on one dataset and build iteratively.
Resources: Microsoft Learn modules on data import.

Step-by-Step Data Preparation Process

Connect and Import Data:

In Power BI Desktop, click Get Data > Select source (e.g., Excel file).
Preview data in the Navigator window; select tables/queries to import.
For large datasets, use "DirectQuery" mode to query live data without importing everything.

Open Power Query Editor:

Review the data preview pane. Columns show data types (e.g., Text, Number, Date).
The Applied Steps pane tracks every change—click a step to undo/redo.

Clean and Transform:

Remove Unwanted Data: Use Home > Remove Rows > Remove Duplicates or Remove Errors.
Handle Missing Values: Right-click column > Replace Values (e.g., fill nulls with 0 or "Unknown").
Change Data Types: Select column > Data Type dropdown (e.g., convert text dates to Date type).
Split/Merge Columns: Home > Split Column (e.g., split "Full Name" into First/Last) or Merge Columns.
Filter and Sort: Use column filters or Sort Ascending/Descending.
Pivot/Unpivot: Transform wide tables to long (unpivot) for better analysis, e.g., turning monthly columns into rows.

Advanced Transformations:

Group By: Aggregate data (e.g., sum sales by region).
Add Custom Columns: Add Column > Custom Column > Use M language (Power Query's formula language) for logic like if [Sales] > 1000 then "High" else "Low".
Merge Queries: Combine tables (e.g., left join sales with customer data on ID).
Append Queries: Stack similar tables (e.g., combine Q1 and Q2 sales data).

Apply and Load:

Click Close & Apply to load transformed data into Power BI.
For complex queries, save as a query group for reuse.
