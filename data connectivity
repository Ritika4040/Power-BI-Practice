Data Connectivity in Power BI

Power BI excels at connecting to a wide variety of data sources, allowing you to import, transform, and analyze data from multiple systems. 
It supports over 70 native connectors, with more available through custom options or APIs. Connectivity is handled primarily through Power 
Query in Power BI Desktop, which enables data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).

Key Categories of Data Sources
Power BI categorizes connectors into groups for easy access. Here's a breakdown:

Databases:

Relational: SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, IBM DB2, Teradata.
NoSQL: MongoDB, Cassandra, Azure Cosmos DB.
Big Data: Hadoop (HDFS), Spark, Hive.

Cloud Services and APIs:

Microsoft: Azure SQL Database, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Synapse Analytics, Dynamics 365, SharePoint.
Other Clouds: Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, Salesforce, Zendesk, GitHub.
Web APIs: RESTful APIs, OData feeds, JSON/XML endpoints.

Files and Spreadsheets:

Local/Cloud: Excel, CSV, TXT, XML, JSON, Parquet.
Folders: Import entire directories of files.

Other Sources:

On-Premises: SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS), SAP HANA, IBM Cognos.
Streaming: Azure Event Hubs, Power Platform dataflows.
Custom: ODBC/JDBC for proprietary systems, or build your own via M language in Power Query.

How to Connect Data

In Power BI Desktop: Go to the Home tab > Get Data > Choose a category (e.g., Database, File) > Select the connector > Enter credentials (e.g., server details, API keys).
Authentication: Supports Windows, database credentials, OAuth, API keys, or Azure Active Directory. For security, use gateways for on-premises data.
Data Refresh: In the Power BI Service, set up scheduled refreshes (up to 8 times/day on free tier; more on Premium).

DirectQuery vs. Import:

Import: Loads data into Power BI's in-memory engine for fast performance (best for static data).
DirectQuery: Queries data live from the source (ideal for real-time or large datasets, but may be slower).

Data Transformation and Modeling

Power Query Editor: After connecting, use this to clean data—e.g., merge tables, pivot/unpivot columns, handle errors, or add custom columns with M code.
Parameters and Dynamic Connections: Create parameters for reusable queries (e.g., switch between dev/prod databases).
Dataflows: In the Power BI Service, build reusable ETL pipelines that feed multiple reports, reducing duplication.

Security and Governance

Gateways: Install On-Premises Data Gateway (personal or enterprise) to securely access on-prem data from the cloud. Supports scheduled refreshes and live connections.
Data Privacy Levels: Set levels (Public, Organizational, Private) in Power Query to control data mixing (e.g., prevent combining public web data with private HR data).
Row-Level Security (RLS): Filter data based on user roles (e.g., managers see all sales; reps see only theirs). Implemented via DAX roles in the model.
